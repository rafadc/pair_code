1
00:13:36237 --> 00:13:37432
Easy, boy.

2
00:14:51326 --> 00:14:53193
What do you expect?
They're savages.

3
00:14:53865 --> 00:14:55959
One lot steals a goat
from another lot,

4
00:14:56084 --> 00:14:58361
before you know it
they're ripping each other to pieces.

5
00:14:58486 --> 00:15:00961
I've never seen wildlings
do a thing like this.

6
00:15:01086 --> 00:15:03396
I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.

7
00:15:04721 --> 00:15:06044
How close did you get?

8
00:15:06169 --> 00:15:08976
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the wall.

9
00:15:11773 --> 00:15:13294
Do the dead frighten you?

10
00:15:13755 --> 00:15:15576
Our orders were
to track the wildlings.

11
00:15:15701 --> 00:15:16826
We tracked them.

12
00:15:17284 --> 00:15:19094
They won't trouble us no more.

13
00:15:19260 --> 00:15:21419
You don't think
he'll ask us how they died?

14
00:15:23547 --> 00:15:25100
Get back on your horse.

15
00:15:29964 --> 00:15:32088
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

16
00:15:32658 --> 00:15:34026
They even killed the children.

17
00:15:35114 --> 00:15:37042
It's a good thing we're not children.

18
00:15:38664 --> 00:15:41241
You want to run away south, run away.

19
00:15:41942 --> 00:15:44139
Of course they will
behead you as a deserter,

20
00:15:44712 --> 00:15:46455
if I don't catch you first.

21
00:15:48957 --> 00:15:50742
Get back on your horse.

22
00:15:51661 --> 00:15:53091
I won't say it again.

23
00:16:24826 --> 00:16:27204
Your dead men
seem to have moved camp.

24
00:16:28170 --> 00:16:29241
They were here.

25
00:16:33279 --> 00:16:34577
See where they went.

26
00:17:21386 --> 00:17:22676
What is it?

27
00:17:24497 --> 00:17:25429
It's...

28
00:20:24859 --> 00:20:28318
-= La Fabrique =-
www.sous-titres.eu

29
00:21:28688 --> 00:21:29506
Go on,

30
00:21:29672 --> 00:21:30964
father's watching.

31
00:21:33756 --> 00:21:34885
And your mother.

32
00:21:41629 --> 00:21:44934
Fine work as always.
Well done.

33
00:21:45059 --> 00:21:46060
Thank you.

34
00:21:46563 --> 00:21:50261
I love the detail that you've managed
to get in these corners.

35
00:21:50386 --> 00:21:51873
Quite beautiful.

36
00:21:51998 --> 00:21:53178
The stitching...

37
00:22:16135 --> 00:22:17971
And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?

38
00:22:19395 --> 00:22:20557
Keep practicing, Bran.

39
00:22:23145 --> 00:22:24146
Go on.

40
00:22:25603 --> 00:22:27242
Don't think too much, Bran.

41
00:22:30358 --> 00:22:31748
Relax your bow arm.

42
00:22:44321 --> 00:22:45664
Quick, Bran!
Faster.

43
00:22:47416 --> 00:22:48557
Lord Stark!

44
00:22:51758 --> 00:22:52922
My lady.

45
00:22:53758 --> 00:22:55814
A guardsman just rode in
from the hills.

46
00:22:56265 --> 00:22:58815
They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.

47
00:23:02640 --> 00:23:04396
Get the lads to saddle their horses.

48
00:23:04521 --> 00:23:05885
Do you have to?

49
00:23:06673 --> 00:23:08460
He swore an oath, Cat.

50
00:23:08817 --> 00:23:10378
The law is law, my lady.

51
00:23:12016 --> 00:23:13652
Tell Bran he's coming too.

52
00:23:15793 --> 00:23:16794
Ned.

53
00:23:17446 --> 00:23:19114
10 is too young to see such things.

54
00:23:20013 --> 00:23:21284
He won't be a boy forever.

55
00:23:23634 --> 00:23:25281
And winter is coming.

56
00:23:52927 --> 00:23:54067
White walkers.

57
00:23:55032 --> 00:23:56504
I saw the white walkers.

58
00:23:57490 --> 00:23:58732
White walkers.

59
00:23:59167 --> 00:24:01776
The white walkers, I saw them.

60
00:24:11193 --> 00:24:12460
I know I broke my oath.

61
00:24:13918 --> 00:24:15213
And I know I'm a deserter.

62
00:24:16237 --> 00:24:18978
I should have gone back to the wall
and warned them, but...

63
00:24:20118 --> 00:24:21372
I saw what I saw.

64
00:24:22322 --> 00:24:23555
I saw the white walkers.

65
00:24:25993 --> 00:24:27307
People need to know.

66
00:24:29754 --> 00:24:31438
If you can get word to my family...

67
00:24:32262 --> 00:24:33692
Tell them I'm no coward.

68
00:24:34327 --> 00:24:35612
Tell them I'm sorry.

69
00:24:53017 --> 00:24:54315
Forgive me, lord.

70
00:24:59420 --> 00:25:01431
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

71
00:25:01556 --> 00:25:03637
- the first of his name...
- Don't look away.

72
00:25:03762 --> 00:25:06264
- King of the Andals and the First Men.
- Father will know if you do.

73
00:25:06606 --> 00:25:09321
... Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and protector of the realm,

74
00:25:09967 --> 00:25:12299
I, Eddard of the House Stark,

75
00:25:13164 --> 00:25:15398
Lord of Winterfell
and warden of the north,

76
00:25:16487 --> 00:25:17859
sentence you to die.

77
00:25:32962 --> 00:25:34038
You did well.

78
00:26:02714 --> 00:26:04030
You understand why I did it?

79
00:26:04640 --> 00:26:06072
Jon said he was a deserter.

80
00:26:06578 --> 00:26:08702
But do you understand
why I had to kill him?

81
00:26:09016 --> 00:26:10368
"Our way is the old way"?

82
00:26:12294 --> 00:26:15709
The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

83
00:26:16927 --> 00:26:18790
Is it true he saw the white walkers?

84
00:26:21387 --> 00:26:24134
The white walkers have been gone
for thousands of years.

85
00:26:25706 --> 00:26:26843
So he was lying?

86
00:26:31558 --> 00:26:33381
A madman sees what he sees.

87
00:26:59840 --> 00:27:00890
What is it?

88
00:27:04165 --> 00:27:05365
Mountain lion?

89
00:27:07073 --> 00:27:09773
There are no mountain lions
in these woods.

90
00:27:55595 --> 00:27:56745
It's a freak!

91
00:27:58930 --> 00:27:59896
It's a direwolf.

92
00:28:09462 --> 00:28:10762
Tough old beast.

93
00:28:13798 --> 00:28:15787
There are no direwolves
south of the wall.

94
00:28:16861 --> 00:28:17996
Now there are five.

95
00:28:19405 --> 00:28:20500
You want to hold it?

96
00:28:25962 --> 00:28:27380
Where will they go?

97
00:28:28133 --> 00:28:29217
Their mother's dead.

98
00:28:29383 --> 00:28:30925
They don't belong down here.

99
00:28:31093 --> 00:28:32428
Better a quick death.

100
00:28:33746 --> 00:28:36598
- They won't last without their mother.
- Right. Give it here.

101
00:28:37624 --> 00:28:38812
Put away your blade.

102
00:28:38937 --> 00:28:40797
I take orders from your father,
not you.

103
00:28:40922 --> 00:28:41853
Please, father!

104
00:28:42862 --> 00:28:44814
- I'm sorry, Bran.
- Lord Stark?

105
00:28:47030 --> 00:28:48630
There are five pups...

106
00:28:49685 --> 00:28:51985
One for each of the Stark children.

107
00:28:52495 --> 00:28:54199
The direwolf is
the sigil of your house.

108
00:28:55588 --> 00:28:57312
They were meant to have them.

109
00:29:03106 --> 00:29:04502
You will train them yourselves.

110
00:29:05502 --> 00:29:07502
You will feed them yourselves.

111
00:29:08130 --> 00:29:10174
And if they die, you will
bury them yourselves.

112
00:29:19058 --> 00:29:20518
What about you?

113
00:29:21606 --> 00:29:23186
I'm not a Stark.

114
00:29:23956 --> 00:29:24957
Get on.

115
00:29:35647 --> 00:29:36743
What is it?

116
00:29:41104 --> 00:29:42582
The runt of the litter...

117
00:29:43307 --> 00:29:44541
That one's yours, Snow.

118
00:30:44839 --> 00:30:47630
As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you:

119
00:30:49982 --> 00:30:52443
You worry too much.
It's starting to show.

120
00:30:53123 --> 00:30:55373
And you never worry about anything.

121
00:30:56072 --> 00:30:59867
When we were seven and you jumped
off the cliffs at Casterly Rock,

122
00:31:00602 --> 00:31:04372
100-foot drop into the water,
and you were never afraid.

123
00:31:04538 --> 00:31:07125
There was nothing to be afraid
of until you told father.

124
00:31:08075 --> 00:31:11225
"We're Lannisters.
Lannisters don't act like fools."

125
00:31:13365 --> 00:31:16716
- What if Jon Arryn told someone?
- But who would he tell?

126
00:31:18248 --> 00:31:20644
- My husband.
- If he told the king,

127
00:31:20769 --> 00:31:23057
both our heads would be skewered
on the city gates by now.

128
00:31:24894 --> 00:31:28294
Whatever Jon Arryn knew
or didn't know, it died with him.

129
00:31:28974 --> 00:31:31449
And Robert will choose a new Hand
of the King, someone to do his job

130
00:31:31699 --> 00:31:34749
while he's off fucking boars
and hunting whores...

131
00:31:35152 --> 00:31:36960
Or is it the other way around?

132
00:31:38141 --> 00:31:39949
And life will go on.

133
00:31:40605 --> 00:31:42535
You should be the Hand of the King.

134
00:31:43664 --> 00:31:45354
That's an honor I can do without.

135
00:31:45604 --> 00:31:47129
Their days are too long,

136
00:31:47379 --> 00:31:49554
their lives are too short.

137
00:32:28667 --> 00:32:32688
All these years and I still feel like
an outsider when I come here.

138
00:32:34995 --> 00:32:36421
You have five northern children.

139
00:32:38067 --> 00:32:39717
You're not an outsider.

140
00:32:41009 --> 00:32:43143
I wonder if the old gods agree.

141
00:32:44241 --> 00:32:46441
It's your gods with all the rules.

142
00:32:52603 --> 00:32:53940
I am so sorry, my love.

143
00:32:56067 --> 00:32:57068
Tell me.

144
00:32:57568 --> 00:33:00101
There was a raven
from King's Landing.

145
00:33:01773 --> 00:33:03241
Jon Arryn is dead.

146
00:33:04280 --> 00:33:05601
A fever took him.

147
00:33:09150 --> 00:33:10832
I know he was like a father to you.

148
00:33:14226 --> 00:33:17088
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health,

149
00:33:17254 --> 00:33:18487
gods be good.

150
00:33:29348 --> 00:33:30726
The raven brought more news...

151
00:33:33069 --> 00:33:35219
The king rides for Winterfell...

152
00:33:36595 --> 00:33:39145
With the queen
and all the rest of them.

153
00:33:40296 --> 00:33:42446
If he's coming this far north...

154
00:33:44272 --> 00:33:45992
There's only one thing he's after.

155
00:33:46807 --> 00:33:48783
You can always say no, Ned.

156
00:33:58014 --> 00:34:01387
We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

157
00:34:01637 --> 00:34:05534
- I'm told he reads all night.
- I'm told he drinks all night.

158
00:34:05784 --> 00:34:09621
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his... stature?

159
00:34:10634 --> 00:34:13461
We've brought up eight barrels
of ale from the cellar.

160
00:34:13711 --> 00:34:17148
- Perhaps we'll find out.
- In any case, candles.

161
00:34:22982 --> 00:34:25756
Why is your mother so dead set
on us getting pretty for the king?

162
00:34:26006 --> 00:34:28409
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

163
00:34:28783 --> 00:34:30787
I hear the prince
is a right royal prick.

164
00:34:30953 --> 00:34:34290
Think of all those southern girls he
gets to stab with his right royal prick.

165
00:34:36375 --> 00:34:38432
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

166
00:34:38682 --> 00:34:40838
He's never met a girl
he likes better than his own hair.

167
00:35:19258 --> 00:35:21008
Gods, but they grow fast.

168
00:35:25130 --> 00:35:27638
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

169
00:35:27763 --> 00:35:30981
How many times
have I told you no climbing?

170
00:35:31106 --> 00:35:33015
But he's coming right now,
down our road.

171
00:35:41108 --> 00:35:42858
I want you to promise me,

172
00:35:43525 --> 00:35:45027
no more climbing.

173
00:35:50232 --> 00:35:51033
I promise.

174
00:35:53367 --> 00:35:54578
Do you know what?

175
00:35:55337 --> 00:35:56412
What?

176
00:35:56580 --> 00:35:58708
You always look
at your feet before you lie.

177
00:36:01543 --> 00:36:04630
Run and find your father.
Tell him the king is close.

178
00:36:49263 --> 00:36:52412
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

179
00:37:05210 --> 00:37:07310
What are you doing with that on?

180
00:37:09590 --> 00:37:10591
Go on.

181
00:37:12631 --> 00:37:13616
Move!

182
00:38:37271 --> 00:38:38321
Your Grace.

183
00:38:43429 --> 00:38:44707
You've got fat.

184
00:39:02933 --> 00:39:05142
Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?

185
00:39:05310 --> 00:39:07772
- Where the hell have you been?
- Guarding the north for you.

186
00:39:08673 --> 00:39:10173
Winterfell is yours.

187
00:39:13768 --> 00:39:16218
- Where's the Imp?
- Will you shut up?

188
00:39:16605 --> 00:39:17698
Who have we here?

189
00:39:19837 --> 00:39:21187
You must be Robb.

190
00:39:23651 --> 00:39:25533
My, you're a pretty one.

191
00:39:27706 --> 00:39:28874
Your name is?

192
00:39:29519 --> 00:39:30318
Arya.

193
00:39:33157 --> 00:39:34707
Show us your muscles.

194
00:39:36175 --> 00:39:37717
You'll be a soldier.

195
00:39:40989 --> 00:39:42988
That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

196
00:39:43238 --> 00:39:45349
Would you please shut up?

197
00:39:55305 --> 00:39:56445
My queen.

198
00:39:57279 --> 00:39:58291
My queen.

199
00:39:58947 --> 00:40:01014
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

200
00:40:01139 --> 00:40:02783
We've been riding
for a month, my love.

201
00:40:03522 --> 00:40:04995
Surely the dead can wait.

202
00:40:05743 --> 00:40:06744
Ned.

203
00:40:17053 --> 00:40:18467
Where's the Imp?

204
00:40:21978 --> 00:40:23334
Where is our brother?

205
00:40:23769 --> 00:40:25474
Go and find the little beast.

206
00:40:27778 --> 00:40:29183
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

207
00:40:30750 --> 00:40:32979
One minute he was fine and then...

208
00:40:34215 --> 00:40:36703
Burned right through him,
whatever it was.

209
00:40:38116 --> 00:40:39376
I loved that man.

210
00:40:40424 --> 00:40:41365
We both did.

211
00:40:42421 --> 00:40:44490
He never had to teach you much,
but me?

212
00:40:44615 --> 00:40:45870
You remember me at 16?

213
00:40:47187 --> 00:40:50408
All I wanted to do
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

214
00:40:50851 --> 00:40:53047
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

215
00:40:54150 --> 00:40:57256
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

216
00:41:01317 --> 00:41:02706
I need you, Ned...

217
00:41:03626 --> 00:41:06849
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

218
00:41:09006 --> 00:41:10519
Lord Eddard Stark,

219
00:41:11787 --> 00:41:14005
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

220
00:41:18633 --> 00:41:20213
I'm not worthy of the honor.

221
00:41:20947 --> 00:41:24152
I'm not trying to honor you.
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

222
00:41:24277 --> 00:41:28074
while I eat, drink and whore
my way to an early grave.

223
00:41:28343 --> 00:41:29797
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

224
00:41:31703 --> 00:41:35504
You helped me win the Iron Throne,
now help me keep the damn thing.

225
00:41:36410 --> 00:41:38752
We were meant to rule together.

226
00:41:39156 --> 00:41:42822
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

227
00:41:43808 --> 00:41:45375
Well, it's not too late.

228
00:41:46892 --> 00:41:48389
I have a son, you have a daughter.

229
00:41:50846 --> 00:41:52446
We'll join our houses.

230
00:42:17268 --> 00:42:20141
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

231
00:42:28583 --> 00:42:30651
Did you hear
the king's in Winterfell?

232
00:42:31037 --> 00:42:32476
I did hear something about that.

233
00:42:32919 --> 00:42:35068
And the queen and her twin brother.

234
00:42:35193 --> 00:42:37898
They say that he is the most handsome
man in the Seven Kingdoms.

235
00:42:38064 --> 00:42:39509
And the other brother?

236
00:42:40011 --> 00:42:43112
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one,

237
00:42:44780 --> 00:42:46073
and there's the clever one.

238
00:42:49613 --> 00:42:51374
I hear they call him the Imp.

239
00:42:52113 --> 00:42:53970
I hear he hates that nickname.

240
00:42:55019 --> 00:42:56864
I hear he's more than earned it.

241
00:42:57252 --> 00:42:59451
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

242
00:42:59576 --> 00:43:01714
prone to all manner of perversions.

243
00:43:02629 --> 00:43:04174
Clever girl.

244
00:43:05570 --> 00:43:07885
We've been expecting you,
Lord Tyrion.

245
00:43:08700 --> 00:43:09701
Have you?

246
00:43:10411 --> 00:43:11695
Already?

247
00:43:15060 --> 00:43:17060
The gods gave me one blessing.

248
00:43:22249 --> 00:43:23693
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

249
00:43:24911 --> 00:43:27656
Should I explain to you the meaning
of a closed door in a whorehouse,

250
00:43:27822 --> 00:43:28622
brother?

251
00:43:28747 --> 00:43:30701
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

252
00:43:30826 --> 00:43:34137
but our sister craves your attention.

253
00:43:35155 --> 00:43:36622
She has odd cravings, our sister.

254
00:43:37132 --> 00:43:38287
A family trait.

255
00:43:39099 --> 00:43:41336
Now the Starks are feasting us
at sundown.

256
00:43:42474 --> 00:43:44140
Don't leave me alone
with these people.

257
00:43:44265 --> 00:43:46382
I'm sorry, I've begun
the feast a bit early.

258
00:43:46806 --> 00:43:49762
And this is the first
of many courses.

259
00:43:50529 --> 00:43:52350
I thought you might say that.

260
00:43:52475 --> 00:43:54348
But since we're short on time...

261
00:43:55208 --> 00:43:56444
Come on, girls.

262
00:44:02458 --> 00:44:04063
See you at sundown.

263
00:44:04370 --> 00:44:05751
Close the door!

264
00:44:18901 --> 00:44:21335
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

265
00:44:23529 --> 00:44:25547
She should be on a hill somewhere

266
00:44:25713 --> 00:44:28178
with the sun
and the clouds above her.

267
00:44:28303 --> 00:44:29867
She was my sister.

268
00:44:30749 --> 00:44:32215
This is where she belongs.

269
00:44:33187 --> 00:44:34907
She belonged with me.

270
00:44:40995 --> 00:44:44107
In my dreams, I kill him every night.

271
00:44:45754 --> 00:44:47886
It's done, Your Grace.

272
00:44:48757 --> 00:44:50259
The Targaryens are gone.

273
00:44:53306 --> 00:44:54558
Not all of them.

274
00:45:05988 --> 00:45:06990
Daenerys!

275
00:45:11553 --> 00:45:12554
Daenerys.

276
00:45:13203 --> 00:45:14721
There's our bride-to-be.

277
00:45:16146 --> 00:45:17147
Look,

278
00:45:17557 --> 00:45:18875
a gift from Illyrio.

279
00:45:20275 --> 00:45:21406
Touch it.

280
00:45:21992 --> 00:45:24027
Go on, feel the fabric.

281
00:45:32747 --> 00:45:34314
Isn't he a gracious host?

282
00:45:37544 --> 00:45:41123
We've been his guests for over a year
and he's never asked us for anything.

283
00:45:41385 --> 00:45:42871
Illyrio's no fool.

284
00:45:43415 --> 00:45:45877
He knows I won't forget my friends
when I come into my throne.

285
00:45:51825 --> 00:45:53247
You still slouch.

286
00:45:58338 --> 00:45:59727
Let them see.

287
00:46:03288 --> 00:46:05258
You have a woman's body now.

288
00:46:23690 --> 00:46:25426
I need you to be perfect today.

289
00:46:28362 --> 00:46:30005
Can you do that for me?

290
00:46:33397 --> 00:46:35552
You don't want to wake
the dragon, do you?

291
00:46:37738 --> 00:46:38555
No.

292
00:46:46131 --> 00:46:48578
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

293
00:46:48703 --> 00:46:50465
they will say it began today.

294
00:47:14443 --> 00:47:16043
It's too hot, my lady.

295
00:47:37564 --> 00:47:38751
Where is he?

296
00:47:39291 --> 00:47:41897
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

297
00:48:00051 --> 00:48:01470
May I present my honored guests?

298
00:48:02524 --> 00:48:05142
Viserys of House Targaryen,

299
00:48:05403 --> 00:48:06989
the third of his name,

300
00:48:07114 --> 00:48:09973
the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

301
00:48:10491 --> 00:48:11804
and his sister

302
00:48:11929 --> 00:48:14526
Daenerys of House Targaryen.

303
00:48:18262 --> 00:48:20115
Do you see how long his hair is?

304
00:48:20761 --> 00:48:23070
When Dothraki are defeated in combat,

305
00:48:23375 --> 00:48:26785
they cut off their braids so the whole
world can see their shame.

306
00:48:27173 --> 00:48:30608
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

307
00:48:32307 --> 00:48:35720
He's a savage, of course,
but one of the finest killers alive.

308
00:48:38036 --> 00:48:39389
And you will be his queen.

309
00:48:40473 --> 00:48:41959
Come forward, my dear.

310
00:49:22385 --> 00:49:23601
Where is he going?!

311
00:49:23726 --> 00:49:26298
- The ceremony is over.
- But he didn't say anything.

312
00:49:26423 --> 00:49:27557
Did he like her?

313
00:49:27723 --> 00:49:29107
Trust me, Your Grace,

314
00:49:29232 --> 00:49:31022
if he didn't like her, we'd know.

315
00:49:34632 --> 00:49:36095
It won't be long now.

316
00:49:36941 --> 00:49:40830
Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea
and take back your father's throne.

317
00:49:41914 --> 00:49:45105
The people drink secret toasts
to your health.

318
00:49:45816 --> 00:49:47897
They cry out for their true king.

319
00:49:51949 --> 00:49:53424
When will they be married?

320
00:49:53872 --> 00:49:54806
Soon.

321
00:49:54931 --> 00:49:57383
The Dothraki
never stay still for long.

322
00:49:57508 --> 00:49:59629
Is it true they lie
with their horses?

323
00:50:00580 --> 00:50:02411
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

324
00:50:02802 --> 00:50:04467
Do you take me for a fool?

325
00:50:05227 --> 00:50:06690
I take you for a king.

326
00:50:07096 --> 00:50:09882
Kings lack the caution of common men.

327
00:50:10298 --> 00:50:12097
My apologies if I've given offense.

328
00:50:12222 --> 00:50:14441
I know how to play a man like Drogo.

329
00:50:14972 --> 00:50:16773
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

330
00:50:18690 --> 00:50:20443
I don't want to be his queen.

331
00:50:25692 --> 00:50:26908
I want to go home.

332
00:50:27819 --> 00:50:28820
So do I.

333
00:50:30388 --> 00:50:32435
I want us both to go home,

334
00:50:33748 --> 00:50:34970
but they took it from us.

335
00:50:35095 --> 00:50:36545
So tell me, sweet sister,

336
00:50:36957 --> 00:50:38360
how do we go home?

337
00:50:41331 --> 00:50:42340
I don't know.

338
00:50:42708 --> 00:50:44896
We go home with an army.

339
00:50:46995 --> 00:50:49017
With Khal Drogo's army.

340
00:50:50389 --> 00:50:53032
I would let
his whole tribe fuck you...

341
00:50:53584 --> 00:50:56715
All 40,000 men and their horses too

342
00:50:56840 --> 00:50:58273
if that's what it took.

343
00:51:15875 --> 00:51:17873
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

344
00:51:18602 --> 00:51:20163
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

345
00:51:20842 --> 00:51:24160
Then he is the stupidest prince
that ever lived.

346
00:51:26898 --> 00:51:28011
He's so handsome.

347
00:51:29846 --> 00:51:31932
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

348
00:51:32098 --> 00:51:34998
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

349
00:51:35532 --> 00:51:36937
Why would he say no?

350
00:51:37396 --> 00:51:40166
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

351
00:51:40879 --> 00:51:42315
He'd have to leave home.

352
00:51:43698 --> 00:51:45184
He'd have to leave me.

353
00:51:47001 --> 00:51:48273
And so would you.

354
00:51:49259 --> 00:51:51162
You left your home to come here.

355
00:51:51731 --> 00:51:53348
And I'd be queen someday.

356
00:51:55353 --> 00:51:56902
Please make father say yes!

357
00:51:57027 --> 00:51:58823
- Sansa...
- Please please!

358
00:51:58948 --> 00:52:01035
It's the only thing I ever wanted.

359
00:52:16058 --> 00:52:19009
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

360
00:52:38897 --> 00:52:39833
Is he dead yet?

361
00:52:45327 --> 00:52:46233
Uncle Benjen.

362
00:52:49406 --> 00:52:50493
You got bigger.

363
00:52:52320 --> 00:52:53489
Rode all day.

364
00:52:54010 --> 00:52:56223
Didn't want to leave
you alone with the Lannisters.

365
00:52:56891 --> 00:52:58535
Why aren't you at the feast?

366
00:52:58660 --> 00:53:00783
Lady Stark thought
it might insult the royal family

367
00:53:00908 --> 00:53:02698
to seat a bastard in their midst.

368
00:53:03973 --> 00:53:06061
Well, you're always
welcome on the wall.

369
00:53:06446 --> 00:53:08338
No bastard was ever refused
a seat there.

370
00:53:08463 --> 00:53:10828
So take me with you when you go back.

371
00:53:10953 --> 00:53:13825
Father will let me if you ask him.
I know he will.

372
00:53:17603 --> 00:53:19239
The wall isn't going anywhere.

373
00:53:20331 --> 00:53:22375
I'm ready to swear your oath.

374
00:53:23232 --> 00:53:25444
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

375
00:53:26066 --> 00:53:27452
We have no families.

376
00:53:28090 --> 00:53:31099
- None of us will ever father sons...
- I don't care about that!

377
00:53:32026 --> 00:53:34512
You might, if you knew what it meant.

378
00:53:38245 --> 00:53:39979
I'd better get inside,

379
00:53:40830 --> 00:53:42888
rescue your father from his guests.

380
00:53:45982 --> 00:53:47142
We'll talk later.

381
00:53:56462 --> 00:53:58329
Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

382
00:54:01702 --> 00:54:03332
What are you doing back there?

383
00:54:04285 --> 00:54:06699
Preparing for a night
with your family.

384
00:54:11686 --> 00:54:13524
I've always wanted to see the Wall.

385
00:54:13649 --> 00:54:15387
You're Tyrion Lannister,

386
00:54:16277 --> 00:54:19089
- the queen's brother?
- My greatest accomplishment.

387
00:54:20516 --> 00:54:22936
And you...
you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?

388
00:54:26595 --> 00:54:28566
Did I offend you?
Sorry.

389
00:54:30998 --> 00:54:32687
You are the bastard though.

390
00:54:34718 --> 00:54:36609
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

391
00:54:38132 --> 00:54:40202
And Lady Stark is not your mother,

392
00:54:40869 --> 00:54:42956
making you the bastard.

393
00:54:45582 --> 00:54:47714
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

394
00:54:49291 --> 00:54:50815
Never forget what you are.

395
00:54:51115 --> 00:54:52824
The rest of the world will not.

396
00:54:53756 --> 00:54:55247
Wear it like armor

397
00:54:56013 --> 00:54:57904
and it can never be used to hurt you.

398
00:55:00099 --> 00:55:02720
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

399
00:55:05150 --> 00:55:07439
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

400
00:55:29773 --> 00:55:31030
You at a feast...

401
00:55:31830 --> 00:55:33578
It's like a bear in a trap.

402
00:55:35554 --> 00:55:37005
The boy I beheaded...

403
00:55:38541 --> 00:55:41222
- Did you know him?
- Of course I did. Just a lad.

404
00:55:42688 --> 00:55:44198
And he was tough, Ned,

405
00:55:45059 --> 00:55:46184
a true ranger.

406
00:55:48088 --> 00:55:49640
He was talking madness.

407
00:55:50865 --> 00:55:52582
Said the walkers
slaughtered his friends.

408
00:55:52707 --> 00:55:54731
The two he was with
are still missing.

409
00:55:58733 --> 00:56:00542
A wildling ambush.

410
00:56:01139 --> 00:56:01951
Maybe.

411
00:56:03520 --> 00:56:05471
Direwolves south of the Wall,

412
00:56:06479 --> 00:56:07901
talk of the walkers,

413
00:56:08304 --> 00:56:11218
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

414
00:56:12222 --> 00:56:13554
Winter is coming.

415
00:56:15864 --> 00:56:17131
Winter is coming.

416
00:56:19051 --> 00:56:20123
Uncle Benjen.

417
00:56:20678 --> 00:56:21809
Robb boy.

418
00:56:21934 --> 00:56:23473
- How are you?
- I'm good.

419
00:56:27024 --> 00:56:29355
Is this your first time
in the North, Your Grace?

420
00:56:31124 --> 00:56:32440
Lovely country.

421
00:56:36376 --> 00:56:39531
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

422
00:56:40990 --> 00:56:43743
I remember how scared I was
when Ned brought me

423
00:56:43909 --> 00:56:45201
up here for the first time.

424
00:56:47579 --> 00:56:48806
Hello, little dove.

425
00:56:50170 --> 00:56:51716
But you are a beauty.

426
00:56:52670 --> 00:56:54711
- How old are you?
- 13, Your Grace.

427
00:56:55267 --> 00:56:56268
You're tall.

428
00:56:56896 --> 00:56:57988
Still growing?

429
00:56:58113 --> 00:56:59382
I think so, Your Grace.

430
00:57:00369 --> 00:57:01553
And have you bled yet?

431
00:57:06842 --> 00:57:08143
No, Your Grace.

432
00:57:09897 --> 00:57:11229
Your dress, did you make it?

433
00:57:13319 --> 00:57:16317
Such a talent.
You must make something for me.

434
00:57:18787 --> 00:57:21164
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

435
00:57:22520 --> 00:57:23575
I hear the same.

436
00:57:23741 --> 00:57:25870
Your daughter will do well
in the Capital.

437
00:57:26387 --> 00:57:29073
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

438
00:57:46317 --> 00:57:47182
Your pardon.

439
00:57:47307 --> 00:57:49976
I hear we might be neighbors soon.
I hope it's true.

440
00:57:50302 --> 00:57:52659
The king has honored me
with his offer.

441
00:57:52784 --> 00:57:55940
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to
celebrate your new title, if you accept.

442
00:57:56448 --> 00:57:58193
It would be good
to have you on the field.

443
00:57:58359 --> 00:58:00350
The competition
has become a bit stale.

444
00:58:00912 --> 00:58:02879
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

445
00:58:03404 --> 00:58:04741
Getting a little old for it?

446
00:58:06863 --> 00:58:08478
I don't fight in tournaments

447
00:58:09005 --> 00:58:10863
because when I fight a man for real

448
00:58:11342 --> 00:58:12999
I don't want him to know
what I can do.

449
00:58:15352 --> 00:58:16628
Well said.

450
00:58:18776 --> 00:58:19931
Arya!

451
00:58:21550 --> 00:58:23303
It's not funny!

452
00:58:23917 --> 00:58:25734
She always does this.

453
00:58:26428 --> 00:58:28189
This was my favorite dress.

454
00:58:28876 --> 00:58:31352
She always does it
and it's not funny!

455
00:58:31643 --> 00:58:32847
Time for bed.

456
00:58:44553 --> 00:58:45708
I'm a Northman.

457
00:58:47948 --> 00:58:49807
I belong here with you,
not down south

458
00:58:49932 --> 00:58:52129
in that rats' nest
they call a Capital.

459
00:58:53552 --> 00:58:55813
I won't let him take you.

460
00:58:57789 --> 00:58:59437
The king takes what he wants.

461
00:59:01276 --> 00:59:02664
That's why he's king.

462
00:59:03836 --> 00:59:04837
I'll say,

463
00:59:05723 --> 00:59:07597
"Listen, fat man."

464
00:59:08812 --> 00:59:11299
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

465
00:59:12244 --> 00:59:13844
"He belongs to me now."

466
00:59:17758 --> 00:59:19390
How did he get so fat?

467
00:59:19964 --> 00:59:22677
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink.

468
00:59:26049 --> 00:59:27680
It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

469
00:59:29748 --> 00:59:30903
Send him in.

470
00:59:33929 --> 00:59:35674
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

471
00:59:36996 --> 00:59:38808
A rider in the night...

472
00:59:38933 --> 00:59:40210
From your sister.

473
00:59:48840 --> 00:59:49829
Stay.

474
00:59:49954 --> 00:59:51553
This was sent from the Eyrie.

475
00:59:57489 --> 00:59:59119
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

476
00:59:59912 --> 01:00:01941
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

477
01:00:10862 --> 01:00:11960
What news?

478
01:00:14361 --> 01:00:16115
She's fled the Capital.

479
01:00:19350 --> 01:00:21627
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

480
01:00:22615 --> 01:00:23670
By the Lannisters.

481
01:00:23969 --> 01:00:25746
She says the king is in danger.

482
01:00:26885 --> 01:00:28370
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

483
01:00:29298 --> 01:00:30839
She doesn't know what she's saying.

484
01:00:30964 --> 01:00:33224
Lysa's head would be
on a spike right now

485
01:00:33349 --> 01:00:35449
if the wrong people
had found that letter.

486
01:00:36391 --> 01:00:38425
Do you think
she would risk her life...

487
01:00:38550 --> 01:00:39937
her son's life...

488
01:00:40408 --> 01:00:43219
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

489
01:00:50912 --> 01:00:52621
If this news is true

490
01:00:52746 --> 01:00:55556
and the Lannisters
conspire against the Throne,

491
01:00:56684 --> 01:00:58502
who but you can protect the king?

492
01:00:59128 --> 01:01:01050
They murdered the last Hand.

493
01:01:01455 --> 01:01:03264
Now you want Ned to take the job?

494
01:01:03631 --> 01:01:05101
The king rode for a month

495
01:01:05541 --> 01:01:07469
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

496
01:01:07785 --> 01:01:09513
He's the only one he trusts.

497
01:01:11774 --> 01:01:13748
You swore the king an oath, my Lord.

498
01:01:14778 --> 01:01:17956
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

499
01:01:18476 --> 01:01:19816
He owes him nothing.

500
01:01:22341 --> 01:01:25297
Your father and brother
rode south once

501
01:01:25879 --> 01:01:27533
on a king's demand.

502
01:01:30404 --> 01:01:31590
A different time.

503
01:01:33650 --> 01:01:34910
A different king.

504
01:02:37096 --> 01:02:40391
When do I meet with the Khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.

505
01:02:40557 --> 01:02:43352
If Khal Drogo
has promised you a crown,

506
01:02:43518 --> 01:02:45034
- you shall have it.
- When?

507
01:02:45282 --> 01:02:46979
When their omens favor war.

508
01:02:48185 --> 01:02:50495
I piss on Dothraki omens.

509
01:02:50996 --> 01:02:53446
I've waited 17 years
to get my throne back.

510
01:03:53511 --> 01:03:54846
A Dothraki wedding

511
01:03:54971 --> 01:03:58109
without at least three deaths
is considered a dull affair.

512
01:04:20875 --> 01:04:23782
A small gift, for the new Khaleesi...

513
01:04:24863 --> 01:04:27674
Songs and Histories
from the Seven Kingdoms.

514
01:04:29251 --> 01:04:30418
Thank you, Ser.

515
01:04:32402 --> 01:04:34644
Are you from my country?

516
01:04:35046 --> 01:04:36878
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

517
01:04:37297 --> 01:04:39801
I served your father for many years.

518
01:04:40489 --> 01:04:42804
Gods be good, I hope to always
serve the rightful king.

519
01:05:06538 --> 01:05:07954
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

520
01:05:09128 --> 01:05:11405
from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.

521
01:05:12423 --> 01:05:14795
The ages have turned them to stone,

522
01:05:14961 --> 01:05:16754
but they will always be beautiful.

523
01:05:19307 --> 01:05:20970
Thank you, magister.

524
01:06:29467 --> 01:06:31455
She's beautiful.

525
01:06:35893 --> 01:06:39046
Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say
thank you in Dothraki.

526
01:06:40095 --> 01:06:42758
There is no word
for thank you in Dothraki.

527
01:07:04112 --> 01:07:05373
Make him happy.

528
01:08:05592 --> 01:08:06635
No.

529
01:08:11010 --> 01:08:12515
Do you know the common tongue?

530
01:08:18499 --> 01:08:19565
No.

531
01:08:23456 --> 01:08:25588
Is "no" the only word that you know?

532
01:08:27323 --> 01:08:28280
No.

533
01:08:57129 --> 01:08:58365
Rough night, Imp?

534
01:08:58826 --> 01:09:01004
If I get through this
without squirting

535
01:09:01130 --> 01:09:03474
from one end or the other
it'll be a miracle.

536
01:09:04334 --> 01:09:06037
I didn't pick you for a hunter.

537
01:09:06162 --> 01:09:08809
The greatest in the land...
my spear never misses.

538
01:09:10175 --> 01:09:12124
It's not hunting if you pay for it.

539
01:09:21230 --> 01:09:23169
Are you as good with a spear
as you used to be?

540
01:09:23643 --> 01:09:25711
No, but I'm still better than you.

541
01:09:29424 --> 01:09:31995
I know what I'm putting you through.
Thank you for saying yes.

542
01:09:34501 --> 01:09:36296
I only ask you because I need you.

543
01:09:37915 --> 01:09:39515
You're a loyal friend.

544
01:09:39807 --> 01:09:40907
You hear me?

545
01:09:41729 --> 01:09:43022
A loyal friend.

546
01:09:43507 --> 01:09:45273
The last one I've got.

547
01:09:46559 --> 01:09:48884
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

548
01:09:50072 --> 01:09:53254
And I'll make sure you don't look
so fucking grim all the time.

549
01:09:54644 --> 01:09:56744
Come on, boys,
let's go kill some boar!

550
01:10:07155 --> 01:10:08326
Come on, you.

551
01:11:32694 --> 01:11:34309
Are you completely mad?

552
01:11:35215 --> 01:11:37768
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

553
01:11:38636 --> 01:11:39595
He saw us!

554
01:11:39763 --> 01:11:41388
I heard you the first time.

555
01:11:46606 --> 01:11:48230
Quite the little climber, aren't you?

556
01:11:49705 --> 01:11:52358
- How old are you, boy?
- 10.

557
01:11:53084 --> 01:11:54184
10.

558
01:12:02911 --> 01:12:04372
The things I do for love.
